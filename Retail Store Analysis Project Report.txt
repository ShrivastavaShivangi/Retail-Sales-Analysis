STORE ANALYSIS IN EXCEL: 

- Downloaded the store data for cleaning, processing, analysis, data visualization, and creating insights in Microsoft Excel.

OBJECTIVE:
A store wants to create an annual sales report for a year, so that they can understand their customers and grow more sales in the consecutive year.


PROBLEM STATEMENTS:
1. compare the sales and orders using single chart
2. which month got the highest sales and orders?
3. who purchased more--men or women?
4. what are different order status in the year?
5. list top 5 states contributing to the sales?
6. relation between age and gender based on number of orders
7. which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
8. highest selling category? 

Data Cleaning:
-check all the columns if there's any null values.
-check all numerical data have numeric values	
- correct the name of column 'AMenount' to 'Amount'	
-replace W, M with women and men in Genders: ctrl+F--replace--replace all
(**repeat for any other columns with same errors)
-replace one, two with 1, 2
-since in state and city columns we can't check spelling of each entry, just make sure there's no null value


DATA PROCESSING:
To establish a connection/relation between different attributes, which can help in further analysis is data processing.
-create an age group to categorize age into 3 groups: 
    =IF(E2>=50, "Senior", IF(E2>=19, "Adult", "Teenager"))
    this will categorize age into Senior, Adult, and teenager
-will add a month column to solve problem statements related to month
    =TEXT(G2, "mmm")
**columns created are highlighted for our reference


DATA ANALYSIS:
-open Pivot Table, select 'new worksheet' option, and click ok.
-a new worksheet will open with PivotTable Fields on right, having filters, rows, columns, and values.

Problem statement 1.:
compare the sales and orders using single chart
   -use values like sum of amount (as sales), count of orderID (as orders) (put in columns), sort by month (put in rows)
   -turn off Grand Total for rows and column in PivotTable settings
   -select the data in pivot table and choose Combo chart in Pivot Chart option. Show secondary axis to represent count of order IDs.
   -Format the chart as per your requirements and copy-paste the chart on a fresh worksheet 'Report', and do the basic formatting.
(***Repeat the similar process for remaining problem statements as per the requirements.)

Once all the charts are pasted and formatted onto the Report sheet, insert slicers for Month, Channel, and Category. 
Right click on the slicers to 'Report connections' and check all the sheets to the slicer. Repeat for all the remaining slicers.
(**slicers act as filters for data and their respective graphical representation.)
